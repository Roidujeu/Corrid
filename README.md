# Corrid
Corrid is a Hadoop project which utilizes the MapReduce module to analyse the correlation of COID-19 total deaths 
to several other factors. It also includes the prediction of vaccine drive.

In order to build it, you'll need:
- Hadoop, and at least basic java module which helps
  with data extraction etc.
- Python version >= 3.
- JDK version >= 8.
- Bash to use the CLI.
- Maven to build the project.

If you're using a unix-like OS, all you have to do is open a terminal, cd into the folder, and execute
the bash script "execute.sh".

If you're using Windows, you'll have to execute Hadoop seperately.
